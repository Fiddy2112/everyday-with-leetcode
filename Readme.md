## LeetCode Daily Challenge

Track daily practice solving LeetCode problems with TypeScript. This repo keeps solutions, notes, and quick run instructions.

### Conventions

- One file per day: `dayN.ts`
- Include a brief header comment: problem name, link, approach, and complexity
- Keep a simple `main()` or example calls with `console.log` for quick checks
- Prefer readable variable names and small, testable functions
