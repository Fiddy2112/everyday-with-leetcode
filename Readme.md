## LeetCode Daily Challenge

Track daily practice solving LeetCode problems with TypeScript. This repo keeps solutions, notes, and quick run instructions.

### Repository structure

- [Exercise1](./exercise/day1.html): solution for [day1.ts](./day1.ts)
- [Exercise2](./exercise/day2.html): solution for [day2.ts](./day2.ts)
- `Readme.md`: this guide and daily log

### Conventions

- One file per day: `dayN.ts`
- Include a brief header comment: problem name, link, approach, and complexity
- Keep a simple `main()` or example calls with `console.log` for quick checks
- Prefer readable variable names and small, testable functions

### Daily log

- Day 1: [day1.ts](./day1.ts) — Problem: Max Consecutive Ones
- Day 2: [day1.ts](./day2.ts) — Problem: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
