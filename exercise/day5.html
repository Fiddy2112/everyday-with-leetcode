    <h1>Merge Sorted Array</h1>

    <h3>
      You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing
      order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in
      nums1 and nums2 respectively.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead
      be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length
      of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be
      merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2
      has a length of n.
    </h3>
    <div class="">
      <p>Example1:</p>
      <p>Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3</p>
      <p>Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]</p>
      <div class="">
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <p>The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].</p>
        <p>
          The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements
          coming from nums1.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Example2:</p>
      <p>Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0</p>
      <p>Output: [1]</p>
      <p>Explanation:</p>
      <p>The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].</p>
      <p>The result of the merge is [1].</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <p>Example3:</p>
      <p>Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1</p>
      <p>Output: [1]</p>
      <p>Explanation:</p>
      <p>The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].</p>
      <p>The result of the merge is [1].</p>
      <p>
        Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only
        there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
