    <h1>Remove Element</h1>

    <h3>
      Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of
      val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then
      return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <h3>
        Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k,
        to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
      </h3>
      <li>
        Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
        elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are
        not important as well as the size of nums.
      </li>
      <li>Return k.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="">
      <p>Example1:</p>
      <p>Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3</p>
      <p>Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]</p>
      <div class="">
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <p>
          Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums
          being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k
          (hence they are underscores).
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="">
      <p>Example2:</p>
      <p>Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2</p>
      <p>Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]</p>
      <p>Explanation:</p>
      <p>
        Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums
        containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4. Note that the five elements can be
        returned in any order.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
        underscores).
